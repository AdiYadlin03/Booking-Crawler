# Star Rating Prediction of Hotels in Paris
This project aims to predict the star rating of hotels in Paris using machine learning models. The data was collected using web scraping with Selenium, and the main goal is to predict whether a hotel is 'good' (has 4-5 stars) or not based on various factors such as location, services the hotels offer, etc.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you understand the project, its dependencies and how to run it on your local machine.

You will need to have the following software installed:

+ Python 3.x
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium, time
+ Web driver for Selenium (e.g. ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file project.ipynb
3. Download the web driver for Selenium and set the path in the code.
4. Install the required libraries using the code cells under "Libraries installation and import".
5. make sure the url's are from "booking.com" and set to the city and dates you want.
6. Run the cells in the notebook according to the instructions to see the results.

## Usage
The project uses the Jupyter Notebook file to showcase the data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The notebook is self-explanatory and has comments for better understanding.
